                <p class="article-one-text">Going to Mars may seem like an exciting and ambitious endeavor, but it's important to consider the potential negative impacts it could have on the planet. One major issue is the lack of water on Mars, which would make it impossible to flush toilets and dispose of waste properly. This means that human waste, such as urine and feces, would pile up and potentially contaminate the planet. Additionally, without the Earth's gravity, human waste would float in the air, creating unsanitary and potentially dangerous living conditions for future Mars settlers. It's crucial that before we take steps to colonize Mars, we find a solution for proper waste management. Until then, it's important to consider the long-term effects of human presence on the planet and consider if the benefits outweigh the potential consequences. Ultimately, it's important that we preserve Mars for future generations and not let it become a dirty and uninhabitable planet.</p>

                <p class="article-two-text">In addition to the waste management issues, potential health risks, ugly fashion and floating feces, there's also the issue of personal hygiene on Mars. Without the ability to flush toilets and dispose of waste properly, the colony would be surrounded by human waste. Furthermore, without access to clean water, it would be impossible to take a shower and maintain good personal hygiene. This means that settlers would be forced to live in unsanitary and potentially smelly conditions, Imagine not being able to take a shower for months, and smelling like donkey poop all the time. Not only will the colony be exposed to harmful radiation and other environmental hazards that could harm the health of settlers, but also the lack of basic necessities like water, air, sanitation, personal grooming and hygiene, make it clear that more research and development needs to be done before attempting to colonize Mars.</p>

                <p class="article-two-text">Going to Mars may seem like a dream come true, but once you're there, it will quickly turn into a nightmare. Not only will you be living in a colony surrounded by floating feces and human waste, but you'll also have to contend with a lack of basic necessities like water, air, sanitation, personal grooming and hygiene. Oh, and let's not forget the food situation. Without the ability to grow crops or bring food from Earth, you'll be reduced to eating poop, or worse, eating the poop from other settlers. And don't even think about trying to have a romantic dinner, the smell of poop will ruin the mood. And let's not forget about the ultimate consequence of the lack of proper waste management, Mars will be filled with poop and you will have to go swimming in it. It's crucial that before we take steps to colonize Mars, we find a solution for proper waste management, sanitation, health risks, personal grooming, hygiene and food. We must consider the long-term effects of human presence on the planet and if the benefits outweigh the potential consequences, otherwise, Mars will be a dirty, smelly and uninhabitable planet.</p>
